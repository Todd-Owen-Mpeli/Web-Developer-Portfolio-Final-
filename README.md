# Web Developer Portfolio
My Final iteration of my Web Developer Portfolio (Updated currently) is constructed solely with HTML, SCSS, Javascript & Jquery - featuring a google maps API, Bootstrap 5 framework, and a custom Scroll Reveal AOS library.

Continuing from my version 2 and versin 1 of my attempt to build a personal web developer portfolio. I wanted to start making my latest portfolio even more interactable.

# Project Context
Produce and display in one central location all the projects I have built. Do display my skill-set in various programming languages, HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Java, etc.  

1. Create & display all my projects
2. Display my knownledge in different programming languages.
3. Show my ability to learn new skills.

# My Objective
In this current iteration of my portfolio whereby I focused more on Javascript & Jquery intergration and general element intractability.

# Lessons Learned
I learned a lot building this application. But mainly how to utilise javascript and Jquery to manipulate the HTML DOM, 
create a dark mode version of my portfolio as well as to create popover featues for displaying additional infomation without loading an additional page.

1. Jquery Effects (FadeIn, Out & Toggle, Hide and Show)
2. Javascript functions, HTML DOM and Browser BOM.
3. HTML DOM, Inputs, Objects & Events.
3. Using google maps Web APIs
4. Git operations specifically init, add, status, commit, remote, push and pull. Additionally creating a remote repository to learn a better development workflow process.
5. SCSS File Structure, _font.scss, color.scss etc. Creating seperate SCSS files for different attributes for better CSS opimazation.
6. Responsive website using Bootstrap 5 class intergration for mobile & tablet view-width breakpoints.

# Personal Improvements
Although I have a fairly good understanding of git operations and connecting to a remote repository. I would like to have a better understanding of team-orientated Git operations in a team workflow. Specifically branch and merge this will initialize a more realistic team development workflow process.

# Potential Future Features
Although my portfolio is fairly functional and provides the minimum viable product of showcasing my projects and skill set. The current version of my portfolio requires a list of improvements.

1. Re-building the entire website with React and Node.js
